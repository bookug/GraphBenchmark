/******** manage the disk-file as Blocks-list ********/
/* All blocks of given file are viewed as an array, extended dynamicly
 * The first block(0, super-block) includes the information 
 * about the whole file(for example, the root Node's Block), 
 * especially a bitset use[MAXBN] which is used to recognize which 
 * block is in use
 * In practical, the normal block numbers from 1 to MAXBN-1, 
 * so 0 can be used as division.
 * (normal block is made of header and data)
 * When file opened, program must read this bitset and create an 
 * freelist(several 10Ms memory),
 * and remember to write back the bitset when closing.
 * We store each Tree-Node as a unit, which may contain several 
 * blocks, not requiring continuous.
 * While the tree is not closed, better to keep root Node in 
 * memory all the time.
