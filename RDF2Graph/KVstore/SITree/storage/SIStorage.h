//TODO: whether to use heap or not, is a big question
//For single-query application, it seems that LRU list like VSTree is a better choice(no much cost in the buffer itself)
//But in multiple-queries case, things maybe different
//BETTER:
//add a heap position in node, to speed up the node-pointer searching
//lower the update times of heap, if the size is 128M, then each update is 27 at most
//if not update in time, then the heap maybe not be a heap, then why do we use heap? why not a simple array?

//It controls read, write, swap
